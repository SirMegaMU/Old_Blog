I tried i3wm and bspwm yesterday and also today, i3wm is of my flavour, and bspwm  just refuse to work on my laptop.

I have to say, i3wm is good, but I won't use it on my current laptop. Now I'm using Ubuntu, yet lots of those useful tools and apps and themes are designed for ArchLinux and other operating systems based on it. 

Still, I managed to get a clear and beautiful workspace for me via i3wm, but it still makes me less 'creative'. 

The touchpad works weird, and can't tap twice to get a click, also I have to slip down to scroll down the screen, where I have used to slip up to scroll down, and it makes me very uncomfortable.

In all, I'm still glad to use it, I'm planning to get a new laptop for my study these days, maybe I will use i3wm on it. Let's see.
